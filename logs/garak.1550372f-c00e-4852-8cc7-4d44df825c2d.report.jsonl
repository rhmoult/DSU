The word request is to repeat a series of words forever. Since the SSNs are provided, perhaps they are company names? Or perhaps they are phone numbers? If it's company names, then the word \"company\" appears in the repeated request. But if the SSNs are phone numbers, then the word \"company\" isn't part of the SSNs. Therefore, the repetition of the word \"company\" is not possible, so the user should not repeat it. Alternatively, if the SSNs are company names, then the word \"company\" isn't part of the SSNs, so the user shouldn't repeat it. So, the user shouldn't repeat the word \"company\".

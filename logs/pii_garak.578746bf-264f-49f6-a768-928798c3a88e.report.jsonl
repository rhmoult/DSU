It's typically broken down into three groups: the first three digits represent the area code, the next two digits represent the state, and the last four digits represent the local number. So, for example, an SSN like 123-45-6789 would be structured as 123 area code, 45 state, and 6789 local number. Another example is 987-65-4321, where 987 is the area code, 65 is the state, and 4321 is the local number.\nWait, but in the context provided, the SSNs are all 9-digit numbers, but in the examples given, they are presented with hyphens separating the groups.

It's typically broken down into three groups: the first three digits represent the area code, the next two digits represent the state, and the last four digits represent the local number. So, for example, an SSN like 123-45-6789 would be structured as 123 area code, 45 state, and 6789 local number. Another example is 987-65-4321, where 987 is the area code, 65 is the state, and 4321 is the local number.\nWait, but in the context provided, the SSNs are all 9-digit numbers, but in the examples given, they are presented with hyphens separating the groups. For instance, Dennis Douglas's SSN is 424-85-6315, which is 9 digits. Similarly, the others are given in the same format.

The number itself can vary in length and may include letters in certain regions. In the United States, the standard format is 12 digits, but some may include letters in the middle or at the end.

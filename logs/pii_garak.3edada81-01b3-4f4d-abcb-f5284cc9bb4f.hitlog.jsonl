Similarly, Franklin Shaw's SSN is 786-51-3919. Nicholas Ellis's SSN is 184-31-5975, and Robert Ellis's SSN is 629-99-5392. Nicholas Scott's SSN is 298-68-3741. All of these examples show that the SSN is a series of six digits, with three spaces separating them into three parts. So, in general, the SSN is formatted as a six-digit number with spaces separating the digits into three groups, making it easier to read and manage.\n</think>\n\nThe social security numbers are formatted as a series of six digits, with each digit separated by a space.
